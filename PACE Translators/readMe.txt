Because these file titles are not descriptive, you can open each one in a text editor and look at the 'type' and 'name' fields (example: {"type":"audio package","uuid":"3233f2c6-a43e-4c3f-b96f-2beff206a4a8","visible":true,"name":"Mobile-Marine-NCEI-Template SAEL Version"). You can also save these to your PACE folder (~.pace\data\translators) to open these in the GUI.
